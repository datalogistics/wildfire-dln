Welcome to the ATAK SDK Developer Guide.


Prereq
==========================

First install atak.apk on your device.   
This version is required for any development work from this repository.
As the plugin repository is updated, this APK may be updated.    


The atak-javadoc.jar file contains all of the javadoc for the ATAK project.


The plugins directory provides a set of examples that can be used to 
guide development.


Setup
==========================

Please see the Requirements for Development under the README.DEV.txt 
for setting up Android Studio and the appropriate environment.   

It is required that you have Android Studio, svn, and Instant Run disabled.

Studio should open up all of the example plugins and deploy them to 
the phone as required.
