== Wildfire-DLN Base Station Image ==

=== Requirements ===
  * Docker environment with external network connectivity

=== Quick Start ===

Within this directory, run:

 > docker build -t "wdln-base" .

Docker will pull the required base image and begin building the
WDLN software.  This may take a considerable amount of time
depending on your hardware.

Once the build is complete, you may launch the base station:

 > docker run "wdln-base"

 use -d flag to run in background.

For an interactive shell in your container:

 > docker run -ti "wdln-base" /bin/bash

To list running images:
 > docker ps      # to list images

To stop a running image:
 > docker stop <id>
