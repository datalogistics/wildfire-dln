Windows users:

Installation of Docker for Windows requires enabling Hyper-V, which disables VirtualBox and VMware,
which is hardly ideal. It is possible to instead install on Linux VM; a tutorial is here:
Instead install on a Linux VM via https://www.linux.com/learn/intro-to-linux/2017/11/how-install-and-use-docker-linux
You needn't follow it after reaching the Pulling Images section. Run the scripts as above.
Allow wdln_setup.sh 15-20 minutes to complete.
